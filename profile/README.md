# OUR STORY
For over two decades [MartinJenkins](https://www.martinjenkins.co.nz/about-us/our-story/) has specialised in providing high calibre organisational, financial, economic and public policy services to clients in New Zealand and beyond. Our energetic team of consultants has a wealth of in-depth knowledge and skills in financial and organisational management, process and business improvement, employment relations, economics, research, evaluation and public policy. By connecting this skill set and applying fresh thinking, we significantly lift our clients’ performance.

MartinJenkins has honed a robust set of strengths that describe the company’s approach to tasks and the useful traits that underpin its client reputation. The ability of our staff to believe in and consistently apply these strengths across projects produces a significant lift in performance. We call this cumulative value for clients the [MartinJenkins Multiplier](https://www.martinjenkins.co.nz/about-us/our-strengths/).

# DATA ANALYTICS
One of the services MartinJenkins has bolstered over the years is its [Data Analytics](https://www.martinjenkins.co.nz/services/data-analytics/), recognising data has been referred to as the *new oil* or the *new gold*. Data in itself is valuable, but when it is transformed and integrated with other material, that's when its potential begins to be reached.

Public sector organisations are dealing with expanding volumes of data and making sure the data held is robust and governed appropriately. They are grappling with the problem of legacy systems, and with the challenge of integrating data, whether across their own agency or across different agencies. There is a need to ensure high-quality evidence, data, and insights exist or are brought to light in a range of policy areas. This includes local government, tertiary education, environment, the health sector, mental health, child poverty, border security, infrastructure, and work to eliminate family and sexual violence.

Our expertise is in using data analytics as a means to an end: we identify, structure, interpret and analyse your data in context of other datasets from the broader environment to create insights that lead to better policy, to more accurate and useful evaluations, to better investment decisions, and to better responses to organisational or strategic problems.

We support our clients to use and apply data analytics by providing a full service across all parts of the data lifecycle, including to validate past decisions. We can help embed analytics and a data strategy into your decision-making so that your choices are genuinely grounded in data. We can make your analytical functions better, improve your data capability, and build better operating models for your data teams.

We apply our sound understanding of government, policy, and regulation, and of the very specific data challenges faced by the public and quasi-public sectors. You need consultants who understand that public-sector data is not just any data.

We also recognised that Māori data sovereignty and privacy obligations are opportunities for public and quasi-public organisations to mature their approach to data management.  

## DATA STRATEGIES & GOVERNANCE
We help organisations develop data strategies and governance that enable them to get the best out of their data and use it safely.

## MEASURING PERFORMANCE
We help clients develop data-driven frameworks for measuring and monitoring their organisational performance.

## DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS
We help clients use data-driven insights to make evidence-based policy and decisions.

## DATA ANALYSIS & STORY TELLING
We support this work in two ways: first, using statistical and econometric analysis and modelling and data triangulation to create meaningful data and insights; second, using story-telling techniques to communicate an intuitive narrative that speaks to the choices that need to be made.
